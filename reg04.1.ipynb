    "Q1: Lasso Regression and Its Differences:\n",
    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,\" is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term (L1 regularization) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss function. Lasso differs from other regression techniques in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Lasso has the unique property of performing automatic feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and the need to identify the most relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Models: Lasso tends to produce sparse models, meaning it selects a subset of the available features by setting others to zero. This can lead to simpler and more interpretable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable Selection: Unlike Ridge Regression, which shrinks coefficients toward zero without setting them exactly to zero, Lasso can be seen as a variable selection method in addition to regression. It can effectively eliminate less important variables."

    "Q2: Advantage of Lasso Regression in Feature Selection:\n",
    "The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select the most relevant features while setting the coefficients of less important features to zero. This leads to a simpler and more interpretable model, reduces overfitting, and enhances the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso is particularly beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where there are many features but only a subset of them is truly influential. By applying Lasso, you can effectively filter out noise and focus on the most meaningful variables."

    "Q3: Interpreting Coefficients in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Interpreting coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in ordinary linear regression. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference with Lasso is that some coefficients are exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding variables do not contribute to the model. Non-zero coefficients reflect the importance and direction of the relationship between the variable and the target. Additionally, the magnitude of coefficients is affected by the L1 regularization penalty, which tends to shrink them towards zero.\n",

    "Q4: Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted as \"lambda\" (Î»). Lambda controls the strength of the L1 regularization penalty in the loss function. Higher values of lambda result in stronger regularization, which tends to set more coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of lambda affects the model's performance in terms of bias-variance trade-off. Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, can help you select an optimal value of lambda. In some implementations, you may also encounter options for choosing the type of penalty (L1 or L2), which influences the form of regularization used."

    "Q5: Lasso Regression for Non-linear Regression Problems:\n",
    "Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique, which means it models linear relationships between independent and dependent variables. It is not designed for capturing non-linear relationships. However, you can still apply Lasso in the context of non-linear regression by using polynomial features or other non-linear transformations of the input variables. This essentially extends Lasso to handle non-linear relationships, but it remains a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For purely non-linear regression tasks, techniques like polynomial regression, spline regression, or kernel-based methods (e.g., Support Vector Regression with non-linear kernels) are more appropriate."
